# Day 1

- I worked on the HTML structure, added all the CSS for both light and dark modes (mobile only), implemented JavaScript to dynamically populate all the cards, animated the checkbox, and added dark mode support. (4 hours)

# Day 2

- I created a new repository, uploaded all the code to GitHub, deployed it using GitHub Pages, fixed the paths for the CSS, scripts, and images, added animations to the checkbox and linear gradient, and made changes to the HTML to enable a linear gradient on the top cards. (1.5 hours)
