## Day 1

- I worked on the HTML structure, added all the CSS for both light and dark modes (mobile only), implemented JavaScript to dynamically populate all the cards, animated the checkbox, and added dark mode support. (4 hours)

## Day 2

- I created a new repository, uploaded all the code to GitHub, deployed it using GitHub Pages, fixed the paths for the CSS, scripts, and images, added animations to the checkbox and linear gradient, and made changes to the HTML to enable a linear gradient on the top cards and completed dark-mode styles . (2 hours)

## Day 3

- I improved mobile, tablet, and desktop responsiveness by adding custom media breakpoints at 567px, 768px, and 992px, fixed hover color styles, and added the missing follower title to the top cards.(30 minutes)

## Day 4

- I improved the mobile, tablet, and desktop responsiveness for the overview cards and made some minor fixes to the spacing and checkbox states to match the design.(30 minutes)
